      <body>
        This project analyzes customer behavior for a <strong>UK-based online retailer</strong> using transactional data spanning 500,000+ rows. The goal was to move the marketing team away from a "mass-marketing" approach toward highly targeted, data-driven strategies. <br>
        <br>
        Using the <strong>RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)</strong> framework combined with <strong>K-Means Clustering</strong>, customers were grouped into distinct segments to inform personalized marketing campaigns and retention strategies. <br>
        <br>
        The analysis was conducted using <strong>SQL (PostgreSQL)</strong> for data engineering and <strong>Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn)</strong> for machine learning and visualization. The key insights and recommendations focus on the following areas:

            <strong>Champions & Loyalists Drive Revenue:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Champions are the highest-value segment — high spenders, frequent buyers, and most recently active customers.</li>
              <li>Loyalists show consistent purchasing behavior with strong spend, making them prime candidates for upselling and VIP programs.</li>

            <strong>New/Recent Customers Show Growth Potential</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>This segment has high recency but low frequency, indicating they are early in their customer lifecycle.</li>
              <li>A targeted second-purchase incentive could convert them into long-term Loyalists.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The elbow plot showed diminishing returns in inertia reduction beyond 4 clusters, confirming k=4 as the ideal number of segments.</li>
            <li>This prevents over-segmentation while ensuring each cluster is meaningfully distinct.</li>

            <li>At-Risk customers show the inverse pattern — low recency, low frequency, and low monetary value — making them the most vulnerable to permanent churn.</li>

        <li>New/Recent Customers Show Recency Without Depth
          <ul>

    <h4>Based on the uncovered insights, here are actionable items the marketing team can apply per customer segment.</h4>
      <h3>Champions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Invite to an exclusive <strong>VIP Loyalty Program</strong> with early access to new products and members-only discounts.</li>
          <ul><li>This segment drives the highest revenue and has the strongest engagement — retaining them has outsized business impact.</li></ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>Loyalists</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Offer <strong>tiered rewards</strong> and personalized product recommendations to increase purchase frequency.</li>
          <ul><li>Loyalists are one step away from Champion status — targeted nudges can elevate their lifetime value significantly.</li></ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>New / Recent Customers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Send a <strong>"second-purchase" discount code</strong> within 7 days of their first order to build purchase habit.</li>
          <ul><li>Converting new customers into repeat buyers is the most cost-effective path to growing the Loyalist segment.</li></ul>
      </ul>
      <h3>At-Risk Customers</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Launch a <strong>re-engagement email campaign</strong> with a personalized "We Miss You" offer and time-limited incentive.</li>
          <ul><li>Customers inactive for 6+ months are at critical risk of permanent churn — a win-back offer can recover a meaningful share before they disengage entirely.</li></ul>
      </ul>
